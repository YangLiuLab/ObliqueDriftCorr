#  Versatile Drift-Free Super-Resolution Imaging Method via Oblique Bright-Field Correlation
This is the example code to calculate the axial position shift from cross correlation map of two bright-field images from two complementary oblique illumination angles (See "Image processing for drift correction" in "Materials and Methods"). It is used for drift correction in single molecule localization microscopy.
