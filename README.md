# ObliqueDriftCorr
This is the example code to calculate the axial position shift from cross correlation map of two bright-field images from two complementary oblique % illumination angles (See "Image processing for drift correction" in "Materials and Methods". It is used for drift correction in single molecule localization microscopy.
